    <h1>Look what you made me do</h1>
    <h2>Taylor Swift</h2>
    <p>I don't like your little games<br>Don't like your tilted stage<br>The role you made me play<br> Of the fool, no, I don't like you<br>I don't like your perfect crime<br>How you laugh when you lie
      <br>You said the gun was mine<br>Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh)<br></p>
    <p>But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time<br>Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
      <br>I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined<br>I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!<br></p>
    <p>Ooh, look what you made me do<br>Look what you made me do<br>Look what you just made me do<br>Look what you just made me-
      <br>Ooh, look what you made me do<br>Look what you made me do<br>Look what you just made me do<br>Look what you just made me do<br></p>
    <p>I don't like your kingdom keys<br>They once belonged to me<br>You asked me for a place to sleep<br>Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)
      <br>The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama<br>But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma<br> And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure<br>Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours<br></p>
    <p>But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time<br>Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time<br> I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined<br>I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!<br></p>
